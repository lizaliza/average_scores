This mini - project will give you some idea of calculating the statistical 
data by means of functions, lists, and translation of mathematical formulas reporting software.
I've created quite a few meaningful functions. 
Namely, i've created helper functions to print 
a list of grades, compute the sum, average, variance, 
and standard deviation about a set of grades.
